The Gettysburg Address shall be split into lines with a maximum of `breakpoint` 
characters, but words shall stay words.

If a word is longer than `breakpoint`, it may trail of over the given limit.

Bonus points shall be awarded for

- Reading the text directly from gettysburg-address.txt.
- Lazy evaluation of the text.
- A clean, text driven approach.

Inspired by Uncle Bob’s essay [“Why Is Estimating So 
Hard?”](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/04/20/Why-Is-Estimating-So-Hard.html).
