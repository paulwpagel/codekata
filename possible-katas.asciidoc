= Possible Katas

== Areas

These are ideas of areas in which katas could be created.

* design style: like the bowling game
* maths
* algorithms
* data structures
* emergent/evolutionary design
* repair
* clean code
* refactoring
* porting
* crossing paradigms
* concurrency
* parsing
* little languages
* loops
* caching
* optimisation
** reduce memory footprint
** reduce cpu usage
** trading space versus memory and vice versa
* switching data structures
* kinds of duplication
* removing patterns
* off by one errors
* ranges
* bugs


== Katas

=== Hoist Kata

Learning how to hoist variables out of for-loops.

- Identify invariant expressions in loops
- Extract a variable that doesn't have side-effects
- Extract variables with no-side effects versus those that have only 1
  side-effect

=== Loop Katas

I think that people would be surprised by the amount of depth that there can be
in something as superficially simple as a for-loop. For instance:

- simple incrementing for-loops such as counting from 1 to 10 printing the
  index.
- simple decrementing for-loops such as counting from 10 to 1 printing the
  index.
- using for-loops to replace recursion for instance traversing a tree and
  printing out the nodes
- learning to reason about nested for-loops
- looking at the ways in which different languages implement them and getting a
  sense for the ways in which they are more or less equivalent but some
  languages have more powerful constructs than others
- the evolution of modern varieties of for-loops
- for-else loops for instance in Python
- the interaction between for-loops and co-routines:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine and McIlroy's original paper
  http://www.iq0.com/notes/coroutine.html
- the relationship between for-loops and other kinds of loops e.g.  while-loops,
  do-while loops and Knuth's loop and a half construct:
  http://pplab.snu.ac.kr/courses/adv_pl05/papers/p261-knuth.pdf

Implement each of these in one or more languages

=== Prime Number Kata

Prime Numbers kata calculates the prime numbers up to 100.

Example::
The prime numbers to 10 are 2, 3, 5, 7.

Clarifying Notes::
A prime number is a integer which is only divisible by itself and 1.
